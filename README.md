<h1>GatherContent asset collecter</h1>
<p>This app is a means to interact with GatherContent's API, and to specifically pull down assets directly to your local machine, bypassing the bundling, zipping, and delivery process. In addition, this app will also build a file structure unique to your GatherContent project, and place the assets directly within proper folder.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pull down the repository</li>
<li>Create a .env file, and add it to the application's directory</li>
<li>Place the following in that file:
<ul><li>ORGANIZATION: [your organization id per Gather Content]</li>
<li>API_KEY: [your api key]</li>
</li>
(You can find your GatherContent API key at https://[Organiztion ID].gathercontent.com/settings/personal)
</ul>

<h3>Running the API</h3>
From the terminal, type ruby /path-to-api/api.rb
Hit enter and knock yourself out!

<p><em>Pinus Albicaluis</em>, or 'Whitebark Pine' is a sub apline conifer that grows in the subalpine zones throughout the western continental mountain ranges.</p>
